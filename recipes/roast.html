    <h1>Mississippi Roast - Slow Cooker Pepperoncini Pot Roast</h1>
        <img src="../images/roast.jpg" alt="Mississippi Roast">
    <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>One of the best roasts ever. I have been making this for a little over 3 years now and it is one of my family's favorite dishes. It Is FABULOUS as is, however As always, I had to tweak it a bit to make it my own. I serve mine over rice and I find that there is not a whole lot of gravy made. to rectify that I pour some of the pepperoncini juice into slow cooker and also add 1 cup of beef broth. Makes it perfect for rice.</p>
